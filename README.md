# NLP
Background
Cryptocurrency has been a popular commodity to trade recently. In this exercise, I analyzed the latest news headlines for Bitcoin and Etherium to obtain a better understanding of how the two coins are perceived by the public using News API.

I applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also applied fundamental NLP techniques to understand the other factors in both coin prices. For example, common words, phrases, and other times the two coins were mentioned in the articles. 

The Skills utilized during this project were:

Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Processing
Named Entity Recognition
Files
Starter Notebook
